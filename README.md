I have created a simple recipe website layout using HTML and CSS. The design features a clean and user-friendly interface where users can browse through various recipes. The layout includes a navigation bar, recipe cards with images and descriptions, and a footer section. I focused on using semantic HTML for structure and applied CSS for styling and layout, including flexbox and grid techniques to ensure responsiveness. This project helped me strengthen my front-end development skills and understand how to structure a basic website.
